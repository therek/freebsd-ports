mod_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like mod_jk and mod_proxy,
mod_cluster uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd
to one of a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod_jk and mod_proxy,
mod_cluster leverages an additional connection between the application
server nodes and httpd. The application server nodes use this connection
to transmit server-side load balance factors and lifecycle events back to
httpd via a custom set of HTTP methods, affectionately called the Mod-Cluster
Management Protocol (MCMP). This additional feedback channel allows
mod_cluster to offer a level of intelligence and granularity not found in
other load balancing solutions.
